  "description": "This is an API created using Express.js, Sequelize ORM and MySQL. User auth is done using Json web tokens. The api is used for a user to register and login using their email, after which the user can acces the protected joke sending route. The route uses the ```https://api.icndb.com/jokes/``` API to send a random joke with the user's fname to the user's email. The e-mail is sent using SendGrid, but this can easily be accomplished using nodemailer."
